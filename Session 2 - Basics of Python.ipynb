    "This program opts for simiplicity over ensuring that it will work realistically in every type of situation. This means our program may potentially several bugs which can be found by testing unique scenarios. For example, what happens if the player hits until the deck is entirely empty? Try adding a condition or two to avoid having this happen.\n",

The score counter will count the first card (the ace) as 11 points and the two sixes as an additional 12 resulting in a bust, even though the ace can be counted as a 1 which would result in a playable score of 13. Try implementing a solution that will count any aces in the player's hand at the very end to get a more accurate score. (Hint: one solution to consider is sorting the player's hand (*list*) at the start of the *score* function. Alternatively an easier solution is to add a new counter to track the number of aces in the hand and wait to add them to the total until the end of the function.)\n",
